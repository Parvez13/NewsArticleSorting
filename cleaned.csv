90,639,could rivalry overshadow election tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain it is message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift ian gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring for goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re election tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster behind closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears and it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip few in westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict it for example the weekend attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments mr blair talked about the new labour manifesto move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on deal to hand him the premiership last year that claim was repeated in robert peston book book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act for his part mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re elected the trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere they started with and are sustained by friends of the two men one only had to listen to the chancellor friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is real anger from this camp at the prime minister apparent attempts to confound mr brown leadership ambitions but it is not just public pronouncements from ex aides there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides it is no secret in westminster for example that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in mammoth sulk and acting in petty and deliberately provocative manner then there are the actions of the men themselves gordon brown sets out what is seen as rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with keynote speech by the chancellor meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is media only obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of government beset by such rivalry either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put lid on all the speculation but with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being particularly difficult trick to pull off ,politics,2

120,1515,apple laptop is greatest gadget the apple powerbook has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc the laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an all time top list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts and or electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be self contained apparatus that can be used on its own not subset of another device in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes gadget gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top is the abacus which the magazine dates at d and put in th place other pre electronic gadgets in the top include the sextant from th position the marine chronometer from nd position and the kodak brownie camera from th position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top which also includes the first flash mp player diamond multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number sony third entry in the top is the cdp cd player from who can forget the crystalline hiss free blast of madonna like virgin emanating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elsener knife the swiss army knife from is at number in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone rd the nintendo gameboy th and the pulsar quartz digital watch th the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser th toy tamagotchi th and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler th almost everyone has mobile phone how many people own powerbook or an ipod the findings of this magazine are not very convincing what about the magnetic compass we still use it years after it was invented am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc flash mp portable cd players etc are really just improvements in technology my favourite true gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing use to froth up my coffee calm down it only in their opinion and any list that includes the taser in the top gadgets has to be suspect swiss army knife and no question about it how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful popular you don need laptop or even pocket calculator to work that one out this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair whilst the americans focus on apple tv remotes and tivo which probably is rather obscure in europe what about the soda stream this gadget changed my pre teen life lap tops may enable you to think different but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy how about astro wars one of the pioneers for computer games remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today however tried it the other day and it was rubbish still great gadget of its time why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pda laptops etc what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for it time technological marvel sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it laptop computer is not gadget it a working tool the sinclair executive was the world first pocket calculator think this should be there as well how about the clockwork radio or gps or pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionised communication which is more than can be said for niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early blessed the original noteboook pc the tandy the size of paper and light three weeks on set of batteries an excellent keyboard modem pity tandy did not make it dos compatible what an apple powerbook it out of date not much of gadget surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such short space of time the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was great improvement over the slide rule the casio pocket calculator that played simple game and made tinny noises was also hot gadget in true gadget it could be carried around and shown off all top are electronic toys so the list is probably better reflection of the current high tech obsession than anything else say this as the swiss army knife only made no sinclair ql machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with true multi takings os shame the marketing was so bad apple triumph of fashion over well everything else utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than tv remote control reveals quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition d also put apple newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason only wish that vulcan inc flipstart wasn just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top how did laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget got mine years ago still wearing and using it lot it stood the test of time psion organiser series should be up there had usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge first think great product innovation the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of err mobile pc why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of less partisan publication would tell you that the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices the psion series the first most practical way to carry all your info around too would back the sinclair spectrum without this little beauty would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that do now d have put the mobile phone high up the list probably nokia model sinclair spectrum it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me taste for programming and that what do for living now wish more modern notebooks even apple newest offerings were more like the pb particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses they

134,227,learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson one of the nice things about being writer is that rarely have to go to an office to work can sit in caf or library with or without wi fi connection and research and write articles if am passing through kings cross station on my way to meeting then can log on from the platform and can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne children writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network but just over week ago arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with new cable modem this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial up connection on her daughter laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting slower and flakier net connection as result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial up she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively but the impact spread into her personal life too she did not take her children to the cinema during half term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas she planned trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website and she did not know where to go fossil hunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found book on fossils but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things she may be unusual but do not think anne is alone according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april and numbers are climbing fast there will certainly be five million by the end of the year dial up users are switching to broadband my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason it is part of the process of adaptation and it is vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with but speed is only small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient it may not be the brave new world of streaming full screen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now and it is certainly better than slow access or no access just ask anne bill thompson is regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital ,tech,1

of others or are you more introspective problem solver in order for virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours referring to the space as work will give those around you clear message that this is professional space it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining network isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry joining professional groups or forming loose association of like minded people may assist it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water and weather tight and the structure is checked for stability it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn this would also allow for well insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate ideally it would be good to have mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities the walls should be dry lined with single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in light colour the owner mentions she might lay new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer level surface would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn as for lighting consider combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights use combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne barn the layout of this office reflects the need to have working area and more relaxed meeting space large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible wireless router access point in the house with wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in weak signal strength you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area your local it supplier will be able to advise on this if you haven already invested in robust firewall and anti virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider laptop computer and docking station with external mouse and monitor or you could use one of the new tablet computers

fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by long way than their upcoming brits performance don really care about the brits he said it going to be great to go down but have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight think the government should do more to help up and coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels rather than expecting the government e the taxpayer to fork out why don some of the megastars put something back in some of britain wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government funds if they can fund football why not fund music areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash the government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks multi billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that as scot living in england appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being success so can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising multi million pound industry when health and education are in such sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn be looking for government subsidies know that if was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping would want to finance myself until was in position to pursue corporate sponsorship yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the masses there are already thousands of state funded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use as long as the government was funding real talent it would be great move would hate to see more pop idol type funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about only if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales if they had government grant to get started they have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they re musician the government shouldn fund music it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn have to fork out great deal yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is great deal of money generated through pop music perhaps tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol style music that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it tax on music pollution if you like though really like franz ferdinand have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately funded organizations like save the music in the us ,entertainment,4

279,352,new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told sony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual games expo in los angeles in may these so called next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higher quality visuals for gamers this should make for better more immersive games in pre recorded video slot during microsoft keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making game in tandem with his next film believed to be battle angel alita the game visual quality would be like lucid dream said mr cameron but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop the first new console microsoft xbox is not expected to reach the shops until the end of games typically take at least months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today according to robert walsh head of brisbane based game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between to make with teams averaging staff in size taking two years to complete title such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start new game studio said mr walsh if you re start up doubt that publisher is going to walk in and give you cheque for however good you are he said mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the best selling the sims games the founder of california maxis studio surprised the conference with world exclusive preview of his next game spore spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures starting with an amoeba sized organism the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs jaws and other body parts evolve eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game don want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers instead of employing lots of artists to create models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers the thing am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright d like to offer an alternative to that new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference oxford based natural motion launched endorphin which enables artists to direct d virtual actor the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs for instance or crumples up after gunshot artists can blend together these visual sequences and include the results in their games the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand and so lessens the need for larger art teams another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester start up genemation its latest tool gencrowd enables artists to create unique photo realistic human faces for games involving lots of people gencrowd works by blending together elements of an in built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities the software can create up to new heads an hour one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of decade ago so smaller teams of half dozen people can still create complete games for the devices the game developers conference included special two day summit dedicated to creating mobile games niche attraction for few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago gdc mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates mobile games are fast growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games furthermore the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the

victors would have no chance when they visited the uk their opportunity to prove him wrong came in with the first official new zealand tour to europe the tourists won their early games with quick thinking inventive approach but press criticism began to grow over their scrum formation that left roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to win over scotland before ireland were despatched in dublin huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in hammering of england new zealand headed to wales to meet country in the midst of its first golden age and the encounter would be the first in series of controversial

the all blacks inclusion of maori players the awesome all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all of their games in france britain and ireland including crushing victory over wales at st helen despite their success the all blacks scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in employing the modern scrum line up against the new zealand rover system for the first time south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two all the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the lions tour series won by new zealand the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating prompting the international rugby board to rule that three

unlikely win over the tourists at rodney parade wilson whinneray side rallied to beat wales their first win at the arms park in four attempts and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour but when they returned home the first question put to them was what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome tourists was draw with east wales as they beat the full wales team in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team ferocious game at the arms park in was edged by the all blacks measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james inspired lions of james

one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from line out television pictures clearly showed that he dived but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded penalty duly converted by brian mckechnie for win since that infamous game the competition has largely left wales new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game crushing win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union centenary game was sign of things to come the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside in brisbane in the semi final of the inaugural world cup the kiwis went on to claim the cup and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill fated tour of new zealand young talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them and after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game but as his views were ignored he along with generation of wales best players chose to head north to rugby league win in cardiff followed for new zealand in and at the world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg crushing kiwi triumph in wembley followed in and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen there was temporary resurgence in the welsh game but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff new millennium stadium in they left with victory bruising defeat followed for wales in hamilton in as hansen built towards the world cup but in australia it was remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope wales were given no chance going into the game but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead early in the second half new zealand rallied to win but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to better future they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen coming to europe with weakened squad at the end of long season an encouraging display against south africa has inspired confident wales camp to believe they can

371,1894,mobiles get set for visual radio the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but could see another big innovation that won just see change in our mobile phone habits it might alter the way we listen to the radio finnish handset giant nokia has been working on technology called visual radio which takes an existing fm signal from radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius senior project manager at nokia was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium he said m very happy to say it not television what we re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today if you have visual radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you don know or there a competition or vote that you like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on visual channel parallel to the on air broadcast you ve just been listening to that visual channel is run from computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to as well as details on the track or artist of particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in similar way to digital television red button content possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on real time basis this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network and there will be cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it ll be two or three pounds per month said mr wasenius but typically what we see happening is the operator offering package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial up connections one thing that is for sure assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be million visual radio enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of basically visual radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in few months time with virgin radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners station manager steve taylor commented listeners can interact with the radio station in new way not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like mp music downloads and the latest gig tickets initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon the and but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them listen again to the interview on the radio five live website ,tech,1

396,1401,be careful how you code new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson if it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them if the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions and the way it amends article of the european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas in the us you cannot build system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re enter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on one click online purchase it is small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long the new proposals go back to although argument about patentability of software and computer implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid they have come to head now after year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then re presented in their original form some national governments seem to be aware of the problems poland has rejected the proposal and germany main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection early in december the british government held consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an item and can only be approved or rejected no discussion or amendment is allowed so why should we be worried first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow more directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else patent this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright patents are not copyright but something much stronger patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately have never to my shame managed to read lord byron childe harold pilgrimage if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained substantial chunk of the poem then could defend myself in court by claiming that had simply made it up and it was coincidence the same does not hold for patent if sit down this afternoon and write brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then am in trouble under patent law at least in the us coincidence is no defence the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us based and they have already had to cope with legal environment that allows patents they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or cross license with other patent holders even this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer and other browsers infringed an eolas patent that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements the damage to software will not happen overnight of course if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas and it will damage europe computer industry we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law bill thompson is regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital ,tech,1

431,1190,call for action on internet scam phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet rogue dialling scams according to premium phone line regulator icstis it has received complaints in recent months about dial up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users knowledge phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for they must warn people earlier about possible fraud icstis said people who use dial up connections can be affected by the scams without realising program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via premium phone line victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill icstis spokesman rob dwight said phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner if my bill goes over the usual month want to know about it straight away don want to be told when it hit phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially inflated traffic he said we alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers he added telecoms ombudsman elizabeth france said certainly would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if do something out of the ordinary so would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have similar approach the biggest phone company bt says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because under the current system once the call has been made there little that can be done gavin patterson group managing director for bt consumer said we do look at customer calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary we re looking at the moment at whether we can improve this but as bt handled million calls day monitoring was quite task in itself he added the government has ordered review of premium line services and is likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future at the moment it cannot demand pay outs on the behalf of customer it can only close illegal services down use free anti virus software avg and free firewall protection zonealarm both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter love of music sites how about isps informing all customers of such facilities the responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues ignorance is and always has been an expensive business does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently so are these people followed up and prosecuted these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp porn and pirated software if people didn visit such sites they be considerably less at risk whatever happened to personal responsibility it seems everyone has to be victim these days part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems secure system should not allow web page or email to download and install anything without the user knowledge these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them they should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going why don bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer request to anyone who falls foul of this scam refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls after you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions they cannot insist on you paying the bill to do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud no customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead then you have nothing to worry about or buy some decent firewall software and anti virus you would not walk out in the freezing cold without coat you would not drive your car without any insurance so why not protect your pc stop blaming the phone companies it not their fault was very impressed with our phone company recently had kept ringing hotline number for kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if was aware there were odd calls to the same number great service and got the tickets as well have colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam he informed the phone company about it they subsequently put block on premium rate numbers three months later another huge bill of over came in the block apparently didn work and he still has to pay for it even though block was in place phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with huge bill otherwise they be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem have been scammed of the operator will do nothing about this and to add insult to injury was charged vat by the government premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented one example was where thieves would set up premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid the telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly know people who have run up large bills despite being it literate from talking to bt in belfast believe that they will shortly be giving out free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing it not the fault of phone companies and at last they are doing something about it it about time that the profiteering by the legitimate phone companies came to an end mainly by doing away with dial up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial up not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly haven fallen victim to rogue dialling scam but think you re seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography in most cases the user is entirely at fault which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them my telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal to to this was because of the scam they simply billed me what particularly galls me over and above having over stolen is that the supplier and the government through vat are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses how about an automatic monthly cap of say on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage at least any disputed amount would be limited far easier for telecoms operator to write off than it is few years back was also the target of such scams but thank god have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all heard was the sound of an attempted connection how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti virus and firewall software is up to date that should prevent the vast majority of these scams ,tech,1

454,881,roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big screen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn children television into box office gold recent years have seen less than successful adaptation of the puppet show thunderbirds and moderately successful version of nesbit five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in he man and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the will soon receive their own costly makeovers with screen versions of the team the dukes of hazzard and even blake seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung in the us replaces the stop motion models of the tv show with polished computer generated animation in similar fashion the thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original puppets and models the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the now defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been significant backlash this cg animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the stop motion roundabout cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site and the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry anderson thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic children tv shows have built in audience that make them ideal for reinvention can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today but think it backfiring what next the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global box office performance the film cost m but only recouped m the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating it can therefore be only matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment after the success of garfield the movie britain shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle with only episodes made of the series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ furry recyclers have already had one big screen outing wombling free but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made comeback advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc supernatural comedy and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald comeback for tv most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed the magic roundabout is out in the uk on february how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf run for his money thundercats loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth back get your hands off the clangers is nothing sacred make movie version of the banana splits what about keanu reeves and richard gere in remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldn be better than the original series could it it always nice to see these old toons re released but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song think ve been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memories think remakes are good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create wider audience and possibly entice new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally d like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and a k get full hollywood remakes leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not patch on the puppet series grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson love to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least rating part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place have fond memories of bod not least of which because look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into film it got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have girlfriend or two it all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for new audience but for me lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are film makers running out of original ideas all can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever recently re watched some episodes and realised that there was level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when was child there was new captain pugwash cartoon made couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation this time computer created flat cell like animation failed to match the original cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in sampling world the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now it just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new it got to be mr benn the story line about man who changes in fancy dress shop steps into door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing if they got decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character muffin the mule perhaps after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know why can the british film industry try making gerry anderson ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people in today media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes dj are sampling or re working and music even computer games from years ago are getting modern re workings personally think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our misty eyed nostalgia alone mary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of vicky pollard character as she lives in high rise council block yeah but no but wasn even there d like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner it demonstrates profound lack of imagination in today film makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern children book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead would have loved to see dungeons dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn come up to scratch the only one that isn to be remade as yet is thundercats which d like to see m an expat living in norway and recently went through period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children programs for my daughters my dearest wish however is to see feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavian rainbow believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because it original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod oh the list could go on and on if transformers movie is indeed on the cards then ll be the first one on amazon buying copy eagerly waiting at the front door with frothy mouth and nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price don care till then ll have to make do with the citreon advert d luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb children programme could morph hold his own in big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch hmmmmm could go on and on danger mouse at m showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best children programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no one could approach oliver postgate wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on whole new level with more life like fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall one puppet show that personally would love to see made into live action movie is joe it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe car of course gerry anderson supermarionation is rich seam of material worthy of big screen big budget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as children movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves it only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isn it d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation love that done in shed clunkiness and you couldn recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in look around you mock authentic style might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega this re gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people ideas because it guarantees to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short term the fact that they will be forgotten in months time is irrelevant g starsky hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it pray they never do remake of chorlton and the wheelies m only and don remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and it a classic the fact it so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though it so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be real shame if they did remake it

463,1688,immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time but no longer both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become campaigning issue but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or alternatively running scared of addressing the problem but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration with quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing poll advantage over the issue now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry and to kick out more failed asylum seekers that has been attacked by the tories as too little too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for europe wide policy on immigration but while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers my concern is that whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take constructive approach to the debate right wing political parties picking up on statements like burden to britain will exploit this and create lot of fear and uncertainty it is precisely that concern and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right racist agenda that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue the challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of general election while also avoiding that trap ,politics,2
464,1882,woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council led by lord woolf published its proposals for england and wales it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity but that has now been changed to one sixth with no reduction for those killers given whole life tariff at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation he said but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said in statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines am confident as result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process it represents tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said ,politics,2

514,2224,how political squabbles snowball it become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they and their supporters need to grow up and stop bickering but this analysis in fact gets it wrong it not just children who fight adults do too and there are solid reasons why even trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they be better off if it ended but everyone wants to have the last word each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just tiny bit to ensure their view is heard their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die now this isn because the participants are stupid it actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them indeed there even piece of economic theory that explains all this nothing as obscure as post neo classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted but ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with it often referred to as the prisoner dilemma based on parable much told in economics degree courses about sheriff and two prisoners the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells but the sheriff desperately needs confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime without confession the prisoners will get minimal sentence on some trumped up charge clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess and they are the only one to confess they ll be let off their crime and he tells them that if they don confess and they are the only one not to confess they ll get life now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess if your partner doesn confess you ll get off completely and if your partner does confess you better confess to ensure you don get life the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up don worry if you don entirely follow it you can to look it up on google where there are entries on it the prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades it is parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly cold war arms race for example classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just few arms rather than lot of arms but as long as each wants just few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high what economics tells us is that once you re in prisoners dilemma unless you are repeating the experience many times over it hard to escape the perverse logic of it it no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on somehow the incentives have to change in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomon wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as way of allocating piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in if the rest of the party can enforce that they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly ,politics,2

concluded the oldest gadget in the top is the abacus which the magazine dates at d and put in th place other pre electronic gadgets in the top include the sextant from th position the marine

technological marvel sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it laptop computer is not gadget it a working tool the sinclair executive was the world first pocket calculator think this should be there as well how about the clockwork radio or gps or pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early blessed the original noteboook pc the tandy the

of its time the first home machine with true multi takings os shame the marketing was so bad apple triumph of fashion over well everything else utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than tv remote control reveals quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition d also put apple newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason only wish that vulcan inc flipstart wasn just vapourware otherwise it would be at the

notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices the psion series the first most practical way to carry all your info around too would back the sinclair spectrum without this little beauty would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that do now d have put the mobile phone high up the list probably nokia model sinclair spectrum it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me taste for programming and that what do for living now wish more modern notebooks even apple newest offerings were more like the pb particularly

598,1338,big war games battle it out the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the original elements for its part the long running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapting the console game rising sun call of duty finest hour casts you as succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war battlefronts including russia and north africa it is traditional first person viewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you on near identical note medal of honor pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of tight knit team and plum in the middle of all out action its arenas are the war pacific battles including guadalcanal and pearl harbour you play one character throughout raw and rather talkative us soldier both games rely on carefully stage managed structure that keeps things ticking along when this works it is brilliant device to make you feel part of story when it does not it is tedious winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii you are first ushered into gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes then made to descend into sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the anti aircraft guns it is one of the finest set pieces ever seen in video game this notion of shuffling the player along studiously pre determined path forcibly witnessing series of pre set moments of action is perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic the genius of something like half life is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection this pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting full on atmospheric experience call of duty comes with suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation finest hour has similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voice overs letting you play number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat the game drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc the mouse control is big reason why along with the sharper graphics top end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with bit more subtlety call of duty on pc was more detailed plot wise and graphically and this new adaptation feels little rough and ready targeting with the ps controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collision detection you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again the game wants to be challenge and is and many players will like it for that it is as dynamic battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour and in pacific assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all of the two games pacific assault gets more things right including little points like auto saving intelligently and having tidier presentation it engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we had to ramp up the settings on high spec machine to get the most out of them finest hour is by no means bad and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming those looking for wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented but they will also have niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break little more ground rather then just being competent ,tech,1

653,877,anglers could face prosecution anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty committee of mps has warned sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended the environment select committee said the mps said they were concerned the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved mps said they called for cast iron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up duty of care in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing mutilation of animals unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal best interest the environment select committee made recommendations after hearing evidence from organisations and individuals one was call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged even if they were to later fail we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government intention to exempt fishing as an activity but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought however in exempting fishing the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given carte blanche to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity the committee added the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill such as the law on abandonment of animals which would be significantly weakened mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect or unnecessary mental suffering to go unpunished committee chairman michael jack said any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest this draft bill is no exception my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn just wait for problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place but mr jack said the bill very much had the feel of work in progress and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs circuses and game bird farms the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament he added ,politics,2

694,2210,time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players the only problem is that the game itself can often be farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the minutes at the end would say it whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter finals against brazil often in friendlies though manager will play his strongest side for the first minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and it very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in side with few changes let alone whole team worth the debate will rage on and m not sure there is satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have training camp instead of friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is canny manager the players have had such hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results it extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes stat that can be used against you england game against holland is good example it looks like good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember sven goran eriksson side were given lesson by spain in the last game they played the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be case of waiting at home with fingers crossed ,sport,3

720,645,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular especially with tech savvy criminals many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless ransom is paid but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk biggest net firms to stop these attacks increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures net firms are realising that it not just about anti virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres mr king said the only way to properly combat these so called distributed denial of service attacks was with intelligent net based systems many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with megabytes of data over short periods of time bigger attacks sending down megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave however he added that it was only matter of time before such large attacks were mounted maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites it about understanding what genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends small part of the entire data flood typically these computers have been infected by virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi tech criminal that set off the virus hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom mail said ms capella we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up energis took similar approach said mr seagrave we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target we have people in places where they shouldn be monitoring tech sites he said sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave ,tech,1
721,1135,rolling out next generation net the body that oversees how the net works grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last years but it is just the start in sense we have hardly started in reaching the whole population the new chair of the internet engineering task force ietf brian carpenter says the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net architecture with broadband take up growing services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net think voip voice over internet protocol allowing phone calls to be made over the net is very important it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms says dr carpenter second it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be service provider with lot of infrastructure with voip you need very little infrastructure distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent years at cern the european laboratory for particle physics as the new chair of the ietf his next big challenge is overseeing ipv the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web at cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web so he is well placed to take on such task the net growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is crucial job of the ietf the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work are open and free for anyone to use and work with the net is built on protocol called tcp ip which means transmission control protocol and internet protocol when computers communicate with the net unique ip address is used to send and receive information the ietf is large international community of network designers operators vendors and researchers working on the evolution of the net architecture and the way this information is sent and received they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps we ve seen some interesting effects over last few years explains dr carpenter the net was growing at fantastic rate at the end of the then there was bit of glitch in we are now seeing very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies like china which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies the number of broadband subscribers via dsl digital subscriber line doubled in year to million according to figures released at the end of the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate explained dr carpenter given it the net was designed for the whole community it has done well to reach millions if you want to reach the whole population you have to make sure it can scale up ipv the standard that will replace the existing ipv will allow for billions more addresses on the net and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world the actual number of addresses with ipv is limited to four billion ip addresses that clearly is not enough when you have billion people to serve so there is technical solution the new version of ip ipv it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits said dr carpenter standards are vital to something as complex as the net and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is big task the difference this next generation standard ipv will make to the average net user is almost invisible our first goal is that it ipv should make no difference people should not notice difference it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer lot of the process will be invisible people are usually given an ip address without knowing it technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled said dr carpenter the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security to dr carpenter the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour people have to be educated about sensible behaviour he says such as ignoring mails that claim you have won something don think it is going to get worse people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do just as you would be concerned walking along dark street we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards it is never ending battle in sense but he adds even if security has improved you still worry bit unfortunately it is just part of life we have duty to do what we can ,tech,1

740,1995,mourinho plots impressive course chelsea win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain they have put themselves in position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won at fulham which was great result given that they had been showing good form as said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have manager who will make it whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is priceless commodity no one can be anything other than highly impressed by mourinho he is regarded as touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho doesn simply talk good game he won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions ve also found him to be very realistic whenever ve heard him he spent lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good just wonder if they lack predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league felt they would never have better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea squad have said believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and have seen nothing to make me change me mind if anything what have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining five four is hockey score not football score in three against three training match if the score reaches send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get result like that in game of against is disgraceful on more serious note it was game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal defence confidence is crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season ,sport,3

809,390,will tory tax cuts lift spirits michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts should he win the next general election he has earmarked billion that will be used to reduce taxes although he still will not say which or how this was the pre election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for tax cut equivalent to about penny off the basic rate of income tax all the money would come from its billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that billion would go on spending plans with billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye catching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said it is move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned bn efficiency savings simply don add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy one of new labour greatest successes before the historic election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play major part in that campaign it is likely and the prime minister probably hopes that the economy will be the deciding factor ,politics,2

846,415,brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster an issue many hoped and believed was above such things it dominated the prime minister monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour as he told journalists am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers there is complete unity of purpose and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing great job and would continue doing it although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown long arranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference well not really as it happens and he repeated what great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world although in the next breath he declared get increasingly alarmed by what read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding in so far as read them of course he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men as far as the timing of the prime minister press conference is concerned there are two options the first is that it was calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its once famed ability to strictly co ordinate announcements through the infamous downing street grid to avert just such allegations either way the effect was the same to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on hugely pertinent issue and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men firstly the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami hit countries it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt then as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott without mentioning the other all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from prominent role in general election planning and had as result started to set out his own platform the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto has embarked on mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission often seen as the prime minister turf has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other the prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that unless lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself ,politics,2

848,487,kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition but the liberal democrats are entering the expected election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his party ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson that only his party offered genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with local income tax he was also happy to offer pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election there was time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self delusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name ,politics,2

956,613,profile gordon brown the ultimate prize of downing street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver record breaking ninth budget gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times he reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and days between and how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors or politicians before him gordon brown was born in glasgow on february the son of church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy at he was canvassing for labour and by his he was leading political activist in scotland he achieved first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete phd his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making name for himself in the scottish labour party his first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael ancram but in he took dunfermline east new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal towns entering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony blair within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury he became shadow chancellor under john smith leadership in after the death of leader john smith in he stood aside agreeing to give tony blair clear run at the leadership during now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington the other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend mr blair supporters say such deal never existed and endless newspaper columns and even television film have been devoted to the alleged deal but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in mr brown continued his devotion to politics during the election campaign he is said to have worked an average of hours day six days week after running on treadmill for an hour each morning this dedication to his career was underlined by comment by mr brown former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of ex king michael of romania who said relationship with him was politics politics politics if that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary days after being born seven weeks prematurely year later in october the couple had son john an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute after recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brown blair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown using the budget as springboard is to revitalise labour campaign amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown including mr milburn but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can and mr blair decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for even if the prime minister intention to serve full third term if elected took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters ,politics,2

1057,678,minimum wage increased to the minimum wage will rise in october benefiting more than people the government has announced adults must be paid at least an hour up from while to year olds will be paid the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in businesses wanted it frozen warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want rate further increase in the adult rate to an hour is provisionally scheduled for october according to the commission many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage challenging we have therefore recommended only slight increase above average earnings and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact said chairman adair turner the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women with many working in cleaning catering shops and hairdressing unveiling the latest increase mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become symbol of decency and fairness for too long poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard working families he said too often people were told to make choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast the government has not accepted the commission recommendation that year olds should be paid at the adult rate but says it will look again at the rate later on mr brown said we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage the national minimum wage is currently set at per hour for those aged and above and at for those aged to per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for to year olds but apprentices are exempt the trade unions congress welcomed the increase but has called for minimum wage by next year but the confederation of british industry cbi called for pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october and david frost director of the british chambers of commerce said the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation what employers are saying to us now is that it at level where it starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country the liberal democrats economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage it not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too he said conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase speaking on bbc radio woman hour mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with promise to cancel income tax for the lowest paid workers there are people on very low salaries very low incomes indeed who really shouldn be paying income tax he said it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below year with say no tax on below the losses in tax can be recouped by having pc tax band for people making over our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only rds of the us perhaps we have to really starting questioning why some products cost more here than they do in the us this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low paid people do make go much further it still not good enough got part time job at when was doing my levels in an attempt to get little money saved for uni this was only years ago and was getting paid an hour and working as hard as any of the older staff maybe it about time year olds got fair wage we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together any increase is certainly welcome news however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage would simply ask them would you be happy to work for less than an hour thought not so then don expect others to either can believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage also personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you it about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and bit of respect wouldn go miss either br gt this is good news the minimum wage has put sense of equality back into worker relationship with their employer wages are supposed to be fair reflection of an employee efforts for too long wages were point of exploitation what could an employer get away with in very simplistic terms this put pressure to keep low paid wages low with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat cat salaries bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of stepping stone rather than hand out here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses we all remember michael howard protestations that the minimum wage would cost million jobs when it was introduced funny how he gone quiet on that one jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in think if any job is worth doing then it worth being paid fair wage for and is hardly fortune if your business cannot pay its workers decent wage then maybe it not being run properly and if it folds better run company will take over its duties and employ more people so everybody wins except incompetent business owners great keep at it tony remember the despair of the and the low wages employers got away with at last we can make difference to people and reward them for working we can afford not to pay decent wage it not jobs at any price economy goodbye sweatshops hello decency the increase in minimum wage is good thing living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely like the rest of the country over the past years has made living for you average years old very difficult in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay for example job did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by an hour hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on regional and national level and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard but might never earn figure salary the chance to branch out on our own work at large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services domestic catering portering etc pay the minimum wage of as the basic rate someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow this is definitely the right step in the right direction it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well this is million votes more good strategy isn it although would not deny people the minimum wage increase its timing stinks am quite prepared for raft of bribes to come from the government before the election and raft of taxes afterwards they are playing us for the fools they think we are this is extremely bad news for any business whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies by increasing overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothing the extra cost this increase will bring will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy which in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting up business in the uk or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere the jubilation felt by low paid workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs this will only lead to reduction in jobs why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india blair say the economy is strong and stable economy however consumer debt and the country debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses that will have no choice but to cut the workforce the timing cannot be coincidental this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is blatant electioneering don mind if it is in our degraded democracy elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed if my maths is right hour week at gives you an annual income just over and raising it to leaves it under the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more businesses complaining might like to take look at corporate pay shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying living wage is really controlling factor in the viability of their firm am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to reasonable level but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost we are already seeing sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as sweat shop but now we are told it is global competition with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing the whole picture needs to be looked at this is great news but that might be because work for minimum wage seems good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get job when you can earn more from claiming than you can from work there is no incentive perhaps step in the right direction if the tuc get their way very large number of smes will have to close this will put more people out of work how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies we are specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us while m delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses as an employee for small nursery know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october increase for the lower paid employees who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum this latest increase of an hour will cause even more financial hardship if the rate rises to then can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees the increase in minimum wage will have serious effect on my business although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales it will mean that will not be taking on new member of staff as planned and will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff overtime being the first to go currently employ staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery of my costs are labour the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobs know about this great idea don bother getting qualifications laze about at school no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don get fined because remember when you do eventually start working doesn matter how lazy you are you ll be guaranteed decent wage the ones who suffer are the employers hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door don believe in the minimum wage at all think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them now before everyone thinks that am some rich kid can assure you am not came from very much working class background and started work years ago on youth opportunity program earning per week worked hard went to college part time got my levels and degree bettered myself now earn figure salary did that through hard work and getting off my backside minimum wage just makes people complacent to ashley of swindon when you earned per week it was worth something these days that would need to be near to to have the equivalent buying power might add that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done years ago at equivalent wages in my day type arguments are view that belong in the your day years ago as graduate working for minimum wage welcome any increase of pay can get disagree with ashley swindon saying have to work harder to get more pay have my gcse a levels and degree and have chosen to work for small business that can afford the wages should be getting should be on at least what m getting but they can afford it we all work hard but the money is just not there but on the plus side love my job and wouldn change it just to get more pay as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional per year these next rises will cost me more have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers so no one really wins in the end in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end on the contrary mr blair wins he wins because he obviously has announced this to be vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the mark there will be more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt namely mine think of us employers as well mr blair we are not all big corporations earning millions all workers should be entitled to fair day pay for fair day work how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining mortgage or saving towards retirement it is good news for many asians living in uk students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country thank mr blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage ,politics,2

1077,1667,games help you learn and play god games in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational says research us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be good way to teach languages ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of chore said mr purushotma there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of video game on computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework but instead of fearing computer games ravi purushotma believes that educationalists particularly language teachers should embrace games one goal would be to break what believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional he said he believes that the phenomenal ability of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation the hard part of learning any language said mr purushotma were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride bike by formally studying gravity he said by contrast said mr purushotma learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on the incidental information about what sim was doing could reinforce what player or student was supposed to be learning said mr purushotma by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about tongue with little context for instance he said in version of the sims adapted to teach german if player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of tired sim stumbling then falling asleep would illustrate the meaning if necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players or students understanding one of the drawbacks of the sims said mr purushotma was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation however online versions of the sims in which people have to move in meet the neighbours and get to know the local town could be adapted to help this although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using game can help people learn mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help getting simulated person to perform everyday activities in make believe world and having them described in foreign language could be powerful learning aid he believes before now he said educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games but he said using pre prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons m hoping now to re create well polished german learning mod for the sequel by this summer he told the bbc news website m encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with japanese and spanish earlier work with colleague on using civilisation iii to teach students about history showed that it could be powerful way to get them to realise that solving society problems can not always come from making single change report on the experiment said students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play using geography and history as tools for their game and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play mr purushotma ideas were aired in an article for the journal language learning and technology ,tech,1

an fm transmitter had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio mr curry is american but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the dutch capital he tried university in the us and ended up back in holland where he hosted music video show he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top video countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet at certain point in was driving in on friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking

here for seven years at that point there something on the internet ve got to go find it and ll see you later but mr curry technology and broadcast interests started to gel couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high speed internet connections were becoming more widely available the mp format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before most importantly mr curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing listen to of the radio that you hear today it radio voices and it fake

air their favourite albeit copyrighted music some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the anti radio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is playboy for his part adam curry pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which

1133,1276,could yukos be blessing in disguise other things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for song ought to be bad for business but in the looking glass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true new report has argued the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say the paper reasoning is complex and is based on sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness after vladimir putin became president in he did not raise taxes but put lot of effort too much critics argue into enforcement since then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach the report highlights the case of sibneft russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year after mr putin came to power the company overall effective tax rate rose from to and sibneft was the target of series of aggressive raids by fiscal police but shareholders benefited hugely sibneft started to pay dividends in and almost bn in and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds according to the authors although variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers does this analysis make sense in part certainly for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and law abiding since companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges something unthinkable in the wilder days of the and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts bn in and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities for start the model assumes that the various parties have clearly defined motivation companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia connections often greased by bribery blur the apparently antagonistic relationship companies can for example persuade officials to overlook non payment of taxes and the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested year ago the russian market has dropped by an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance ,business,0

speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukip chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be parody of the party the men have left mr kilroy silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be member of ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people shall not he said will be standing at the next general election shall be leading vigorous campaign for the causes believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy silk would deliver better as the leader of eurosceptic party spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has moral obligation if not legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroy silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead veritas it the bnp in an expensive suit it all well and good robert kilroy silk claiming that veritas is party that doesn believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two horse race trend in my opinion this is just publicity stunt which has just been used as smoke screen for his anti islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many it really is time that the uk government ceased to be paper tiger on this issue in addition as an ashfield constituent would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoon good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done let hope kilroy silk ukip and the euro sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as country want to go not running away from it all mouth and trousers clown trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into third term whatever kilroy silk and ukip do none of their anti european policies have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from right wing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland hopefully this all this fighting within euro sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we can rely on the usa forever at last an impetus for increasing the likely turn out for the election the electorate is disillusioned with british politics kilroy has one agenda the uk and ll be voting for him both ukip and rk are representatives of small mindedness and lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiff many people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls ve always thought that kilroy silk was self publicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion brilliant about time this country had plausible party having seen the recent bbc documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of number of senior ukip figures can well understand why kilroy silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action fantastic news pro europeans now have far less to worry about from the right the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid and the extreme anti europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections robert kilroy silk ego and vanity are his own and his supporters worst enemy as euro enthusiast could not be more delighted by kilroy silk behaviour he took party that was just building up head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting coup etat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two the closer to straight down the middle the better as far as am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose we have ballot papers mile long you ve got to hand it to kilroy silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self belief whilst not being great fan of kilroy do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him am also leaving ukip believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means the eu comments last week about michael howard plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is matter for the eu and not individual member states the sooner we leave this corrupt super state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk has used latin name for his new party rather than good old british name is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompous think mr kilroy silk has got very good point british politics has become too pc and as result has no straight talking honest strong politicians they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power as result feel our democracy is being abused and want it stopped if mr kilroy silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote honestly who really cares man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no idea as one of kilroy silk east midlands constituents hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip democratic nature kilroy is an able communicator and capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not he tried to make it work but they didn seem to want to grow up he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media this new party seems logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man say oh please this is an amusing irrelevance there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument they will play key part in winning the country round to the idea of reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim this have suspicion that he talks for larger part of the electorate that his critics would like shall be voting for him the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy silk but for the ukip kilroy silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip party list he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament wouldn write off kilroy silk while he a clown and one man band at the moment he a populist and that always dangerous the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success good luck to kilroy though think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting somewhat uphill battle the man once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my country knight in shining armour he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today but people are almost too scared to express them kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me what more look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation without hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever great stuff the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only english speaking country fully committed to europe oh and send us over those hard working immigrants our economy needs them this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show united front and give the uk public serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroy silk has gone now ukip at least has chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have lot to offer instead we have split party and damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk it is great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting ukip has wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that party committed to plain speaking should have latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country kilroy silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroy silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party it all flash and no real policy here let hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of veritas symbolises that,politics,2

1417,192,the ticking budget facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george bush are highly controversial the washington based economic policy institute which tends to be critical of the president looks at possible fault lines us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for dose of shock therapy without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come under direct threat will be the federal government ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund as soon as the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in years by conservative estimates to more than half the nation total annual output this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business even now growing share of us borrowing is from abroad the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china among other nations this does not bode well for us influence in the world the decline of the dollar is warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue the dollar is already sinking before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards that will be the shock interest sensitive industries will feel pain immediately sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget the public outcry will force congress to act whether it will act wisely is another matter how did this happen by definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending but this neutral description doesn adequately capture the current situation federal revenues are at levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades much higher in addition the united states has two significant military missions the bush administration chosen remedy is the least feasible one reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem indeed if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left law enforcement space exploration environmental clean up economic development the small business administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear it fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed the biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor to some extent increases in these areas are inevitable the us population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world but serious savings can only be found where the big money is savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill serve the nation elderly and indigent on the revenue side the lion share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since will have to be replaced some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes finally blind allegiance to balanced budget will have to be abandoned there is no good reason to fixate on it anyway moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts second should be dispassionate re evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism third must be the start of serious debate on large scale health care reform one thing is certain destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century ,business,0

1432,1178,labour mps fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at general election and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during meeting of the parliamentary labour party the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election as one hugely disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting it is time they realised it not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt it is sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand as paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect stephen pound echoed the message saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division we remember the they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown stead and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors even mr prescott admitted that had he still been backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good or can even be sustained through the campaign remains to be seen even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for week the prime minister is to deliver keynote speech on election themes for third term and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime minister hand for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign mind you we have heard similar pledges before ,politics,2
